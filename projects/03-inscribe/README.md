## Basic information

project name: Inscribe

Project establishment date 2023.11.11

## Overall introduction to the project
<!-- - Project background/original reasons/problems to be solved (If there are other attachments, they can be placed in the `docs` directory. Submit in English). -->
  - I have an idea to create a business card platform based on blockchain. Because many individuals and organizations have many outstanding ideas, but they lack appropriate opportunities to showcase themselves, and they are unable to meet outstanding talents and realize these outstanding ideas together.

  - Therefore, I plan to build a platform where everyone can showcase themselves.

  - The platform's functions include creating business cards, sending business cards, destroying business cards, and exchanging business cards. In addition, the platform will also provide services for verifying information. I sincerely hope that everyone can communicate freely on this platform and at the same time find suitable partners to stimulate creativity.

- Technology Architecture
  Build Smart Contract On Gear / Vara Network && User Front End store on IPFS or Other decentralized platforms.
